# Simple WEB Service with Slim Framework
This very simple example of web service by Slim.



##API Authentication
I have created api_key by the md5 of the user email and user name. You can set api_key generation by any combination as you needed.
For any api call first you need to get token and then you can send request for any operation by this token.
for my case i have set token expired time to 10 minutes. You can set token expire time as you needed.
## USES
see the request.php inside example folder.
